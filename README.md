# spelling-game-bakery
A set of simple bakery-themed games for studying spelling.

These programs, written in Javascript, are intended to supplement books 4 and 8 of "STORIX", a Korean EFL book series for kindergarten-age students published by Yeamoonsa. The games do not include any copyrighted material; they only incorporate the target vocabulary from these books.

In the games, cupcakes move down the screen from top to bottom, carrying the letters that players need to complete spelling a set of specific vocabulary words. For each word, all the letters except one are shown to the player, so only one letter is needed to complete each word. An image at the top of the page indicates the word that needs to be spelled; only one word is elicited at a time. Cupcakes and their letters are captured by clicking on a large button when the cupcake passes by the letters of the word that are already shown. If an incorrect letter is chosen, a red "X" appears with an image suggesting a mistake.
